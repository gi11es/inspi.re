inspi.re was a photo competition website that ran from 2008 until 2013. The version in this repository is the last one I wrote in 2009. It was later rewritten by the person who took the reigns after I left.

At its peak, inspi.re served 1 million unique pageviews per month and 19,000 unique visitors. Thousands of competitions have taken place on it.
